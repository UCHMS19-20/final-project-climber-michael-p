what do I need?
    *make player movement correspond with user imput
    *create obstacles that fall ??randomly?? but with increasing difficulty
    *maybe other stationary obstacles 
    *detect when an obstacle touches the player
    *associate movement with a change in character image (cycle between two images)
    *count how many "feet" the player has climbed
